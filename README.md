# Debiasing-NLP-Models

For my Master's Capstone project, analyzed biases that exist in created datasets with words obtained through a study, by analyzing word vector representations and word embeddings. Created and trained machine learning models to evaluate the biases of top-related words to words from a list of sample words relating to religion. Debiased these models by modifying word vector representations through a debiasing matrix to encourage correlations between unbiased words, rather than stigmatized or negative words. Analyzed the effectivity of doing so through running WEAT tests.
